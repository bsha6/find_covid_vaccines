# find_covid_vaccines
This is a quick webscraper project that checks availability of vaccine appointments for CVS, Giant, and Harris Teeter.

While using this program, please ensure that those who need the vaccine are able to get it first.  

## Scheduling
You can use cron to have the program run intermittently in the background.

## Bot Detection
The Harris Teeter website will occasionally get suspicious and trigger an "are you a robot" pop up.
